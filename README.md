A basic JS/jQuery-driven in-window javascript console in the vein of iTerm/OSX Terminal.

Include console.js in your page. Please note: jQuery is a dependency.

Instantiate:

<code>
$(document).ready(function() {
  
    Console.init();
  
});
</code>

DONE! Open/close the console with the tilde (~) key.
